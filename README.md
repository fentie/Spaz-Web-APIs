# Spaz Web APIs #

These are web APIs written in PHP for use with Spaz clients. They may be useful to others as well.

The code here is really just the `custom` directory from a [FRAPI](http://getfrapi.com/) install. FRAPI is a PHP-based application for building RESTful APIs quickly. It's really awesome.

## Requirements ##

 * [Anything FRAPI requires](http://frapi.github.com/installing/index.html)
    * Currently, we're just using APC for caching. We may move to Memcached at some point, but not sure.

## Installing ##

 * [Install FRAPI](http://frapi.github.com/installing/index.html)
 * Overwrite the existing `FRAPI_PATH/src/frapi/custom` with our `custom` directory
 * In theory, it's now working.

## Participating ##
